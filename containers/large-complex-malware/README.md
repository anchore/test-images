This image uses a large base image and malware signatures to test malware scanning.

The image uses the same malware signature files as used in `malware-complex-test`, but is based on
a large nvidia image instead of an alpine image.

Contains 2 different malware signatures in variety of paths, embedded in archives, etc.

The malware snippets are MSShellCode.40 and eicar.com. The files used here are not set to execute and only contain the minimal
signature bytes necessary to trigger a match, not a full example of an infected file or full attack payload.
